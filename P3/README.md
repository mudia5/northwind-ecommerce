## Set Up

### 1. Clone this repository 

`git clone https://github.com/mudia5/northwind-ecommerce.git`

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

On macOS/Linux:
`python -m venv .venv`
`. .venv/bin/activate`

On Windows:
`python -m venv venv`
`venv\Scripts\activate`

### 3. Install dependencies 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 4. Create a local copy of the Boston Area Activities database

`cd app`

`sqlite3 boston_activities.db < schema.sql`

### 5. Populate `boston_actitivies.db` with data

`python3 generate_data.py`

The deprecation messages may be ignored as they do not affect the output.

`cd ..`

<!-- ### 6. Initialize the database

`flask --app app init-db` -->

### 6. Run the server

`flask --app app run --debug`

### Approach to testing 

We followed a **Test-Last (Traditional) approach**, where the code was implemented first and tests were written afterward to validate functionality, allowing us to iterate quickly during development. We focused on **unit testing**, where we validated individual functions in isolation. We structured our tests by writing a dedicated test file for each application module, systematically testing each function one by one. To maximize coverage, we wrote additional tests and incorporated parameterized testing to ensure each branch within a function was called. Since some functions involved database interactions and session management, many of these unit tests also served as **integration tests**, verifying that components such as database queries, authentication, and session handling worked together correctly. We used pytest and Flaskâ€™s test client to automate our testing process. By combining these approaches, we achieved a **comprehensive test coverage of 92%**, validating both individual functions and cross-component interactions to ensure the reliability of our application.
