# Project 3: A Real-World Database Application

This real-world database application offers **residents of the Boston area** a centralized platform to discover and engage with **local activity groups**. Users can browse groups by name or category, join communities, register for events, and even create and manage their own groups. The goal is to make it easier for individuals to connect with like-minded people and get involved in local activities through organized and reliable information.

## Deploying the Application 

### 1. Clone this repository 

`git clone https://github.com/mudia5/northwind-ecommerce.git`

`cd northwind-ecommerce/`

<br>

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

On macOS/Linux:


`python3 -m venv .venv`

`. .venv/bin/activate`

On Windows:


`python -m venv .venv`

`attrib +h .venv`

`.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

<br>

### 3. Install dependencies 

`cd P3/`

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

<br>

### 4. Create a local copy of the Boston Area Activities database

`cd app/`

`sqlite3 boston_activities.db < schema.sql`

<br>

### 5. Populate `boston_activities.db` with data

`python3 generate_data.py` // _The deprecation messages may be ignored as they do not affect the output._

`cd ..`

<br>

### 6. Initialize the database

`flask --app app init-db`

<br>


### 7. Run the server

`flask --app app run --debug`

Look for the `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000` message and visit the printed url in your browser 

<br><br>

## Testing
### Running the tests

1. Run all tests: `coverage run -m pytest`

2. View coverage report: `coverage report`

 
### Approach to testing 

Similar to Project 1, we followed a **Test-Last (Traditional) approach**, where the code was implemented first and tests were written afterward to validate functionality, allowing us to iterate quickly during development. We focused on **unit testing**, where we validated individual functions in isolation. We structured our tests by writing a dedicated test file for each application module, systematically testing each function one by one. To maximize coverage, we wrote additional tests to ensure each branch within a function was called. We used pytest and Flaskâ€™s test client to automate our testing process. We achieved a **comprehensive test coverage of 95%**, ensuring the reliability of our application.

## Special Features

### Events
In addition to supporting activity groups across the Boston area, our application offers functionality for **managing local events** hosted by those groups. Users can browse upcoming events, register to attend, host their own, and even leave reviews. Event sign-ups are tracked in real time, and integrity constraints ensure that attendance never exceeds the maximum capacity specified by the event host. In doing so, our platform provides **a centralized hub** for any and all information Boston residents might need to engage with local communities and events. 

### Authentication
Our application includes a user authentication system that allows individuals to register accounts and **access personalized features**. Logged-in users can manage their group memberships and event registrations, create events, submit reviews, and access pages restricted to authenticated users. If an unauthenticated user attempts to access the create event or create group forms, they are redirected to the login page, ensuring secure and appropriate **access control**.

### Error Handling
To maintain the consistency and reliability of the data, we implemented extensive integrity constraints in the Project 2 database design, particularly NOT NULL and CHECK constraints. In the web application, we built on this foundation by incorporating front-end and back-end error handling to **prevent system crashes** and instead provide **informative feedback** to users. For example, the event creation form displays clear error messages when an invalid date is submitted (e.g., a past date or incorrect format), and the review submission form warns users if a rating falls outside the valid 1â€“5 range. Furthermore, forms cannot be submitted if the required fields are blank. 

### Flexibility
We intentionally designed our forms to be **flexible** and **user-friendly**. Many input fields are optional, allowing for greater customization and ease of use. Event hosts may choose whether to set a maximum attendee limit, group creators can optionally define age restrictions, and users can submit ratings with or without accompanying comments.
